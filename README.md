Introduction to the research

In this research on predicting employee attrition, the study undertakes a comprehensive exploration into the landscape of workforce dynamics, employing advanced machine learning models to forecast employee attrition rates. Leveraging tools such as Google Colab, Excel, Power BI, and Google Drive, collaboratively navigates challenges posed by limited datasets and privacy concerns. The models, including Random Forest Classification and Gaussian Naive Bayes, undergo rigorous refinement through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Key attributes influencing attrition, such as “ReportingPersonCode”, “AverageMonthlyWorkingHours”, “DesignationCode”, “ Allocated Leaves”, “Used Leaves”,  “Level2Code”, and “Age”, are identified and analyzed. The results culminate in strategic recommendations for organizational enhancement, addressing relationship efficiency, work-life balance, career development, leave management, job position alignment, and age-inclusive work environments. The findings contribute nuanced insights into predicting and understanding employee attrition dynamics, emphasizing the practical application of machine learning models in fostering strategic workforce planning and organizational resilience.

problem addressed in brief

The research problem revolves around accurately predicting employee attrition, which significantly affects organizational functioning and success. With annual attrition rates of 12%-15%, companies face challenges such as decreased morale, disrupted workflow, and loss of business opportunities. Attrition not only leads to the loss of skills and knowledge but also incurs substantial recruitment and training costs. Moreover, frequent turnover impacts customer satisfaction due to inexperienced staff. Proactive prediction of attrition can enable targeted retention strategies, yet comprehensive research is needed to identify key factors and develop accurate prediction models. By addressing this issue, the study contributes to human resource management and organizational effectiveness, offering recommendations to improve workforce management and foster a positive work environment for long-term success in competitive markets.

Methodology

Data Collection: Obtained third-party employee information from MiHCM company, including attributes such as tenure, absenteeism, and designation codes.
Preprocessing: preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Feature Selection: Used techniques like PCA and conditional probability to identify the most relevant features contributing to employee attrition.
Model Development: Implemented machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees to develop predictive models based on the selected features.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the developed models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Validation: Validated the models using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalization.
Interpretation: Interpreted the results to identify the most significant factors influencing employee attrition and provide actionable insights for organizational decision-making.
Feedback Incorporation: Incorporated feedback from MiHCM company to refine and improve the models and methodologies as necessary.
